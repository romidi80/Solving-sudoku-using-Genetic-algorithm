Finding the solution for sudoku using genetic algorithm

In this project, our objective is to tackle the Sudoku problem using a genetic algorithm approach. The initial step involves presenting the Sudoku problem within the context of a genetic problem-solving framework. Following this, we proceed to elucidate the process of implementing genetic descriptors to represent and solve Sudoku puzzles.

To initiate this process, we delve into the definition of genes, with each gene corresponding to an individual tile or square within the Sudoku grid. The genetic makeup of an entire Sudoku grid, comprising 9x9 tiles, forms a chromosome.

The foundational aspect of this approach is the "Chromosome" class. Each instance of this class encapsulates an array of genes, where each gene represents a tile in the 9x9 Sudoku grid. This configuration results in a chromosome housing a total of 81 genes, reflecting the grid's size. Moreover, a crucial attribute known as "fitness" is attributed to each chromosome. The determination of this fitness metric takes place within the "calculate_fitness" function, elaborated upon in the ensuing code description.

After constructing the gene and chromosome components, the subsequent phase entails the generation of an initial population of chromosomes. Remarkably, this is accomplished without relying on any preexisting hints or information. The chromosomes are created through a process of randomization, thus embodying a diverse initial population.

To enhance the population's genetic makeup, a fitness function is formulated. This function acts as a parameter driving the creation of subsequent generations. The evolution of generations involves employing crossover and mutation techniques, the specifics of which are elaborated upon in the subsequent discussion.

To prevent stagnation within the population and facilitate continuous progress, measures are taken to ensure that the population does not remain fixed or stagnant. If none of the chromosomes in the population satisfy the solution criteria, new populations are generated.

The ultimate goal of this endeavor is to ascertain whether the population has successfully converged to a solution state. This determination hinges on evaluating the fitness of the chromosomes.

In summary, this project involves adopting a genetic algorithm to address the Sudoku problem. This entails defining genes and chromosomes, establishing a "Chromosome" class, generating initial populations, optimizing fitness through genetic mechanisms, and iterating towards a solution while avoiding stagnation. The implementation is guided by the principles of genetic problem-solving.
