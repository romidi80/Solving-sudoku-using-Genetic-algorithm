    "**solve:** solve finally solve the problem using all functions and methods wich we have implemented till now. because it is too long, we would break this code in parts and give a summary of each part.\n",
    "\n",
    "**part1-hyper parameters:** we define some hyper parameters in order to find the solution in such more efficient way and also avoide loosing good chromosomes after achieving to closer fitnesses to goal fitness and also to avoid generation to get stucked in a same generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "(**the reason that the algorythm might stuck in a sonstant generation is that the generation might get very simmilar chromosomes in that generation and also each posible children that could be generated from twi chromosomes, allready exists in the generation and also mutaion would decrease the fitness so mush that it would be removed and extincted after some generations.**) \n",
    "\n",
    "to avoid getting stuck, we use **stale** parameter wich stores the number of generation that the fitness hasn't changed for more than 100 generation. if so we would regenerate the nation. \n",

    "phi is for checking if the gneratin is converged enough or noy and sigma would control the rate of the changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "mutation,crossover and selection ranges has been discussed previously in the project and as we said they are used for controlling the rate of happening of these methods.then we have phi and sigma wich the idea of this is in refrence[6] wich are implimented to controll the rang of mutaion. as the best fitness in a generation gets higher it would limit the number of mutations to avoid loosing good chromosomes.\n",

    "**part2-generating the new population:** wich it self contains 3 part **1-** elites wich pass 0.06% of each generation to next generation. **2-** children of crossover method, **3-** mutated childrens. each part is defined priviously in project. the last part we have used a function to generate the mutation rate in order to controll aor generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "at last if we achiv to fitness 234 it means we have achived to goal and we will print out the tables."
